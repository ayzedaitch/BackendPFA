            <column name="description" value="The Moqri family was a wealthy family of merchant origin that rose to prominence within the royal government (or makhzen). Originally from Tlemcen, they immigrated to Morocco in the early 19th century under the leadership of Patriarch Abu Abdallah al-Akhal, and settled in Fez in 1805. His son Haj Abdesalam al-Moqri became Secretary of the Treasury under Sultan Moulay Hassan, before later being put in charge of royal construction. He supervised the construction of Dar Batha and the adjacent Dar al-Beida palace in Fez. It was Haj Abdelsalam who built Dar Moqri in the late 19th century, its size and wealth reflecting the family's wealth at the time. The house is located in a district historically known as al-'Uyun (the Springs) and known today as the Ziat or Ziyat district, which until the 19th century was a garden district with relatively plenty of open space to build, thus attracting the construction of several new mansions by wealthy families. The Glaoui and al-Tazi families, for example, also had their own palatial residences in the same district, which still exist today. " />

It is located in the Zqaq el-Bghal district, a short distance south of rue Tala'a Seghira . History The exact date of the house's construction is unknown, but it was built in the late 17th or early 18th century. The house is named after one of its first owners, Abd al-Khaliq 'Adiyil. He was a wealthy merchant who was amin (provost or magistrate) in Fez under the Alawite sultan Moulay Ismail (ruled 1672-1727), then became governor of the city under his son, sultan Moulay Abdallah (ruled 1729-1734). Adiyil was also responsible for the construction of Funduq al-Najjarin to the east. After his death in 1747, the house became government property and in the 19th century, it was used as a treasury office. Coins were minted here for the city and indirect tax revenues were collected here before being transferred to the central treasury. At the time of the creation of the French protectorate over Morocco in 1912, the house became the regional headquarters of the Service des Arts Indigènes (Indigenous Arts Service/Office, which oversaw the study and preservation of historical heritage, under the direction of Alfred Bel at the time.
